# Key Decisions Log (Quick Reference)

## Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js App Router:** Chosen for server-side simplicity and performance.
- **Supabase:** Chosen for speed of setup (Auth + DB + Storage) and easy Row Level Security.

### Mental Model: "Rails-like"

- **Decision:** We treat Next.js Server Components like "Controllers" and Client Components like "Views".
- **Why:** Simplicity. Keeps logic on the server, reduces client-side state complexity.

## Technical Decisions

### No TanStack Query

- **Decision:** Use direct Server Actions and Server Components instead of TanStack Query.
- **Why:**
  1. **Simplicity:** Avoids managing `isLoading`/`useEffect` chains on the client.
  2. **Mental Model:** Matches the "Rails" approach (fetch -> render).
  3. **Performance:** Data fetching happens close to the DB.
- **Trade-off:** Less "live" out of the box (requires `revalidatePath`), but simpler code.

### Feature-Driven Directory Structure

- **Decision:** Group files by domain (`components/items`, `app/inbox`) rather than type.
- **Why:** Better collocation of related logic.

## Product Decisions

### "Inbox" First

- **Decision:** All new saves go to Inbox first.
- **Why:** Reduces friction at capture time. "Decide later."
